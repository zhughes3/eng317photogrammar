					This project originally began as a collaboration between the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill's Southern Historical Collection, UNC Libraries, Yale University's Photogrammar Project, and Dr. Courtney Rivard's English 317 Networked Composition Course during the 2016 Spring semester. English 317 students designed the metadata schema for the Life Histories in order to put into practice theories of rhetoric and information infrastructure that they had learned and to mark up these Life Histories so that they could be integrated into the existing Photogrammar map which visualizes the photographs taken by the United States Farm Security Administration and Office of War Information. When this project is complete and all Life Histories have been integrated into the project, the result will be a platform that allows users to search and visualize what life was like during the Great Depression in way that was never before possible.
